SPCR regresses a dependent variable onto a few supervised principal components computed from a large set of predictors.
The **steps** followed by SPCR are the following:

1. Regress the dependent variable onto each column of a data set of *p* possible predictors via *p* simple linear regressions. This results in *p* bivariate association measures.
2. Define a subset of the original *p* variables by discarding all variables whose bivariate association measures less than a chosen threshold.
3. Use the subset of original data to estimate *q* PCs.
4. Regress the dependent variable onto the *q* PCs.

A key aspect of the method is that both the number of PCs and the threshold value used in step 2 can be determined by cross-validation.
GSPCR **extends** SPCR by allowing the dependent variable to be of any measurement level (i.e., ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal) by introducing likelihood-based association measures (or threshold types) in step 1.
Furthermore, GSPCR allows the predictors to be of any type by combining the PCAmix framework (Kiers, 1991; Chavent et al., 2017) with SPCR in step 3.

The `gspcr` R package allows to:

- **tune** the of the threshold values and number of PCs in a GSPCR model;
- **plot** the cross-validation trends used to tune the threshold value and the number of PCs to compute;
- **estimate** the GSPCR model on a data set;
- **predict** observations on both the training data and new, previously unseen, data

Before we do anything else, let us **load the packages** we will need for this vignette.
If you don't have these packages, please install them using `install.packages()`.


```r
# Load R packages
library(gspcr)
```

# Parameter tuning

We start this vignette by estimating `gspcr` in a very simple scenario with a continuous dependent variable and a set of continuous predictors. First, we store the **example dataset** `GSPCRexdata` (see the helpfile for details `?GSPCRexdata`) in two separate objects:


```r
# Comment goal of code
X <- GSPCRexdata$X$cont
y <- GSPCRexdata$y$cont
```

Then, we randomly select a **subset of the data** to use as a training set. We use 90\% of the data as training data.


```r
# Set a seed
set.seed(20230415)

# Sample a subset of the data
train <- sample(x = 1:nrow(X), size = nrow(X) * .9)
```

Now we are ready to **use the** `cv_gscpr()` **function** to cross-validate the threshold value and the number of pcs to be used.


```r
# Train the GSPCR model
out <- cv_gspcr(
  dv = y[train],
  ivs = X[train, ]
)
```

We can then **extract** the cross-validated **solutions** from the resulting object.


```r
# Extract solutions
out$sol_table
```

```
         thr_value thr_number Q
standard -1268.236          2 1
oneSE    -1268.236          2 1
```

# Graphical output

We can visually **examine the solution paths** produced by the cross-validation procedure by using the `plot()` functions.


```r
# Plot the solution paths
plot(out)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="fig-solution-paths-1.svg" alt="Figure 1: Solution paths produced by `cv_gspcr`."  />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: Solution paths produced by `cv_gspcr`.</p>
</div>

In this figure, the out-of-sample fit measure obtained with a given threshold value (X-axis) and a given number of principal components is reported on the Y-axis.
The values of the threshold considered are reported on the X-axis, and the X-axis title reports the type of threshold used, in this case, the simple regression model likelihoods.
For a different number of components considered, a different line is reported. The number of PCs is reported on the line.

Because the fit measure used by default for a continuous dependent variable is the F-statistic, we should look for the highest point on the Y-axis of this plot.
This point represents the best K-fold cross-validation fit.
As you see, the standard solution reported above matches the one presented in this plot.

# Estimation

Once the cross-validation procedure has identified the values of the threshold and the number of PCs that should be used, we can **estimate the GASPCR model** on the whole training data with the function `est_gspcr()`.


```r
# Estimate GSPCR on the whole training data
gspcr_est <- est_gspcr(out)
```

# Prediction

We can now **obtain predictions** for new unseen data using the `predict()` function


```r
# Predict new data
y_hat <- predict(
    object = gspcr_est,
    newdata = X[-train, ]
)

# Look at the first six predictions
head(y_hat)
```
