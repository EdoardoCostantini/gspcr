\usage{
\method{plot}{gspcrout}(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  labels = TRUE,
  errorBars = FALSE,
  discretize = TRUE,
  print = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{gspcr}.}

\item{y}{The CV fit measure to report on the Y axis. Default is the fit measure specified in \code{cv_gspcr()}.}

\item{labels}{Logical value. \code{FALSE} hides the labels of the points indicating the number of components used. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{errorBars}{Logical value. \code{TRUE} shows the error bars for each point. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{discretize}{Logical value. \code{TRUE} treats the X-axis as a discrete measure that facilitates comparing solution paths between different fit measures. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{print}{Logical value. TRUE prints the plot when the function is called. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to methods. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
A scatter plot of \code{ggplot} class
}
\description{
Produces a scatter plot showing the CV score obtained by \code{cv_gspcr} (Y-axis) with different threshold values (X-axis) for a different number of components (lines).
}
\details{
The bounds defining the error bars are computed by \code{cv_gspcr()}. First, the K-fold cross-validation score of the statistic of interest (e.g., the F score, the MSE) is computed. Then, the standard deviation of the statistic across the K folds is computed. Finally, the bounds used for the error bars are computed by summing and subtracting this standard deviation to and from the K-fold cross-validation score of the statistic.
