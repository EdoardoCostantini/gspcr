\details{
The variables in \code{ivs} do not need to be standardized beforehand as the function handles scaling appropriately based on the measurement levels of the data.

The \code{fam} argument is used to define which model will be used when regressing the dependent variable on the principal components:
\itemize{
\item \code{gaussian}: fits a linear regression model (continuous dv)
\item \code{binomial}: fits a logistic regression model (binary dv)
\item \code{poisson}: fits a poisson regression model (count dv)
\item \code{baseline}: fits a baseline-category logit model (nominal dv, using \code{\link[nnet:multinom]{nnet::multinom()}})
\item \code{cumulative}: fits a proportional odds logistic regression (ordinal dv, using \code{\link[MASS:polr]{MASS::polr()}})
}

The \code{thrs} argument defines the bivariate association-threshold measures used to determine the active set of predictors for a SPCR analysis.
The following association measures are supported (measurement levels allowed reported between brackets):
\itemize{
\item \code{LLS}: simple GLM regression likelihoods (any dv with any iv)
\item \code{PR2}: Cox and Snell generalized R-squared is computed for the GLMs between \code{dv} and every column in \code{ivs}. Then, the square root of these values is used to obtain the threshold values. For more information about the computation of the Cox and Snell R2 see the help file for \code{\link[=cp_gR2]{cp_gR2()}}. When using this measure for simple linear regressions (with continuous \code{dv} and \code{ivs}) is equivalent to the regular R-squared. Therefore, it can be thought of as equivalent to the bivariate correlations between \code{dv} and \code{ivs}. (any dv with any iv)
\item \code{normalized}: normalized correlation based on \code{\link[superpc:superpc.cv]{superpc::superpc.cv()}} (continuous dv with continuous ivs)
}

The \code{fit_measure} argument defines which fit measure should be used within the cross-validation procedure.
The supported measures are:
\itemize{
\item \code{F}: F-statistic computed with \code{\link[=cp_F]{cp_F()}} (continuous dv)
\item \code{LRT}: likelihood-ratio test statistic computed with \code{\link[=cp_LRT]{cp_LRT()}} (any dv)
\item \code{AIC}: Akaike's information criterion computed with \code{\link[=cp_AIC]{cp_AIC()}} (any dv)
\item \code{BIC}: bayesian information criterion computed with \code{\link[=cp_BIC]{cp_BIC()}} (any dv)
\item \code{PR2}: Cox and Snell generalized R-squared computed with \code{\link[=cp_gR2]{cp_gR2()}} (any dv)
\item \code{MSE}: Mean squared error compute with \code{\link[MLmetrics:MSE]{MLmetrics::MSE()}} (continuous dv)
}
